# React-Quote-App

Loosely a continuation of my previous quote page but also based on the freecodecamp assignment: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine
CSS/visuals are very similar with some changes here and there. I used framer-motion for the the text-fade effect. The logic/code behind it all though is my own.
